In today's energy market, the role of an electricity broker is becoming increasingly important. An electricity broker acts as an intermediary between consumers and energy suppliers. Their main goal is to help businesses and people find the best electricity rates and plans for their needs.

## What Does an Electricity Broker Do?

[Electricity brokers](https://termina.io/) analyze various energy plans from multiple suppliers. They compare rates, terms, and conditions to find the most cost-effective options.

Common Misconceptions About Electricity Brokers

*   Brokers are not just for big companies. Many large businesses use brokers, but small businesses can also benefit from them. Brokers can help small businesses find competitive rates that they might not access independently.
